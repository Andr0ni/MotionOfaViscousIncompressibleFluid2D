# SimulationOfFlowAroundAnObstacle2D
Numerical solution of the equations of motion a viscous incompressible fluid (2D) in variables of the vortex-flow function. Simulation of the process of flow around an obstacle(Karman street).

The Reynolds number(Re) is a value that characterizes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous friction forces in viscous liquids and gases
